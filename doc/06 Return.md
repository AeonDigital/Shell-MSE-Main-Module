# 06 - Return

A function return can be defined using the following properties:

- `type`        [ string ]  
  Declaration of a type that can be expected as a result of the function
  You can use the Union Types feature or the "void" type.

- `description` [ string ]  
  optionally you can describe the details that influence the processing
  return or how it should be interpreted by the user

  
By default the result is printed with the "echo" command but it will be
stored in "MSE_LAST_FUNCTION_RETURN" global variable too.
